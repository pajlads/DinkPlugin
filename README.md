# Dink

Dink sends webhook messages upon noteworthy in-game events.
While Dink supports the Discord webhook format (with rich embeds and optional screenshots), it also includes additional metadata that allows custom webhook servers to analyze messages or even generate their own messages.
This project was forked from UniversalDiscordNotifier, but has more features, reliability, configurability, testing, and maintainer activity.

Have a suggestion (e.g., new notifier, additional data), bug report (as rare as it may be), or question? Let us know on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/pajlads/DinkPlugin/issues)!

## Basic Setup

To use this plugin, a webhook URL is required; you can obtain one from Discord with the following steps:  
<sub>If you already have a link, skip to step 4.</sub>

1. Click the server name (at the top-left of your screen) and select `Server Settings`.
2. Select the `Integrations` tab on the left side and click `Create Webhook` (if other webhooks already exist, click `View Webhooks` and `New Webhook`).
3. Click the newly created webhook, select the target Discord channel, and click `Copy Webhook URL`.
4. Paste the copied link into the `Primary Webhook URLs` box in the Dink plugin settings.
5. (Optional): If you would like different webhook URLs to receive different sets of notifications, you can instead paste the link into each relevant box in the `Webhook Overrides` section. Note: when a notifier has an override URL, the notifier ignores the primary URL box.

## Notifiers

- [Pet](#pet): Send a webhook message upon receiving a pet
- [Speedrunning](#speedrunning): Send a webhook message upon completing a quest speedrun (with special configuration for personal best times)
- [BA Gambles](#ba-gambles): Sends a webhook message upon receiving high level gambles from Barbarian Assault
- [Player Kills](#player-kills): Sends a webhook message upon killing another player (while hitsplats are still visible)
- [Group Storage](#group-storage): Sends a webhook message upon Group Ironman Shared Bank transactions (i.e., depositing or withdrawing items)

## Other Setup

Some notifiers require in-game settings to be configured to send chat messages upon certain events (so these events can serve as triggers for webhook notifications).

- Collection notifier requires `Settings > All Settings > Chat > Collection log - New addition notification` to be enabled
- Pet notifier recommends `Settings > All Settings > Chat > Untradeable loot notifications` to be enabled (which requires `Settings > All Settings > Chat > Loot drop notifications`) in order to determine the name of the pet
- For Kill Count notifier, ensure you do _not_ enable `Settings > All Settings > Chat > Filter out boss kill-count with spam-filter` (note: this setting is already disabled by default by Jagex)

### Example

## Advanced Features

- Multiple webhook urls are supported; simply place each on a separate line
- Each notifier can send webhook messages to separate "override" urls
- Screenshots can be individually configured for each notifier
- Screenshots are compressed if needed to comply with Discord limits
- The chat box (and private messages above chat) can be hidden from screenshots
- The plugin can skip notifications if the current player name is on the user-configured RSN ignore list
- Users can choose whether their webhook messages are sent in Discord's rich embed format or a traditional format
- The player name in Discord rich embeds can be linked to various tracking services (from HiScores to Wise Old Man)
- Discord rich embed footers can be customized with user-specified text and image url
- When network issues occur, Dink can make repeated attempts to send the webhook (with exponential backoff)

## Chat Commands

### Export Current Configuration via `::dinkexport`

Dink allows you to export your current plugin configuration to the clipboard via the `::dinkexport` chat command.

You can share this produced JSON to friends who want to send similarly configured messages.

This export includes settings across all of the notifiers, but omits webhook URLs. If you also want to include webhook URLs in the export, you can use the `all` parameter to the command: `::dinkexport all`.

If you _only_ want to export the webhook URLs, run the `::dinkexport webhooks` chat command.

You can export just the settings for select notifiers.  
Simply run: `::dinkexport <notifier section header name without spaces>`.  
For example: `::dinkexport pet` or `::dinkexport collectionlog`.

#### Examples

- Export notifier settings, primary webhook URLs & webhook override URLs  
  `::dinkexport all`
- Export Slayer & BA Gambles Notifier settings  
  `::dinkexport slayer bagambles`
- Export webhook overrides only  
  `::dinkexport webhookoverrides`
- Export all webhooks & the Levels notifier settings:  
  `::dinkexport webhooks levels`

### Import Configuration via `::dinkimport`

With the output of the above command (`::dinkexport`) copied to your clipboard, you can merge these settings with your own via the `::dinkimport` chat command.

This import can replace all of your notifier settings.
However, webhook URL lists and ignored RSNs will be combined, rather than outright replaced.
If you would like all settings overwritten rather than merged during import, simply press the `Reset` button at the bottom of the plugin settings panel to clear out all settings (including URLs) before running `::dinkimport`.

After an import, if the dink plugin settings panel was open, simply close and open it for the updated configuration to be reflected in the user interface.

Note: There is no undo button for this command, so consider making a backup of your current Dink configuration by using the `::dinkexport all` command explained above and saving that to a file on your computer.

Warning: If you import override URLs for a notifier (that previously did not have any overrides), this will result in the plugin no longer sending messages from that notifier to your old primary URLs.
As such, you can manually add your primary URLs to the newly populated override URL boxes so that notifications are still sent to the old primary URLs.

## Notifier Configuration

Most of the config options are self-explanatory. But the notification messages for each notification type also
contain some words that will be replaced with in-game values.

### All messages:

`%USERNAME%` will be replaced with the username of the player.

<details>
  <summary>JSON Example:</summary>

```json5
{
  "content": "Text message as set by the user",
  "extra": {},
  "type": "NOTIFICATION_TYPE",
  "playerName": "your rsn",
  "embeds": []
}
```

</details>

The examples below omit `embeds` and `playerName` keys because they are always the same.

### Death:

`%VALUELOST%` will be replaced with the price of the items you lost. If you died in PvP, `%PKER%` will be replaced with the name of your killer.

By default, to avoid spam, Dink will ignore deaths from the following [safe](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Minigames#Safe) activities/areas: Barbarian Assault, Castle Wars, Chambers of Xeric (CoX), Clan Wars, Last Man Standing (LMS), Nightmare Zone (NMZ), Pest Control, player-owned houses (POH), Soul Wars, TzHaar Fight Pit.
However, PvM deaths as a hardcore group ironman are _not_ considered to be safe (and _will_ trigger a notification in these areas).
Lastly, Dink makes exceptions for Inferno and TzHaar Fight Cave; deaths in these areas _do_ trigger notifications (despite technically being safe).

**Note**: If _Distinguish PvP deaths_ is disabled, the message content will be the non-PvP version.

<details>
  <summary>JSON for non-combat death:</summary>

```json5
