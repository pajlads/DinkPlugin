# Dink

This is a fork of Universal Discord Notifier. It doesn't strictly stick to the Discord webhook format, it has a bunch of
added metadata that allows the webhook server to analyze messages or even generate its own.

## Other Setup

As the collection notification uses the chat message to determine when a collection log item has been added, these
messages need to be enabled in game. You can find this option
in `Settings > All Settings > Chat > Collection log - New addition notification`

## Config Options

Most of the config options are self-explanatory. But the notification messages for each notification type also
contain some words that will be replaced with in-game values.

#### All messages:

`%USERNAME%` will be replaced with the username of the player.

JSON:

```json5
{
  "content": "Text message as set by the user",
  "extra": {},
  "type": "NOTIFICATION_TYPE",
  "playerName": "your rsn",
  "embeds": []
}
```

The examples below omit `embeds` and `playerName` keys because they are always the same.

#### Death:

`%VALUELOST%` will be replaced with the price of the items you lost. If you died in PvP, `%PKER%` will be replaced with the name of your killer.

**Note**: If *Distinguish PvP deaths* is disabled, the message content will be the non-PvP version.
