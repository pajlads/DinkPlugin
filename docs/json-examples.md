### Structure

Every Dink `POST` request is a [multipart](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2046#section-5.1) body.

In particular, the `Content-Type` is [`multipart/form-data`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7578) to accomodate the below JSON and optional screenshots in accordance with the [Discord API specification](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files).

Thus, any third-party consumer should utilize the body entity named `payload_json` to access the relevant JSON object. The optional body entity for the screenshot is named `file`, and the underlying data stream (which should not exceed 8MB) can be `image/png` or `image/jpeg` (less common).

Due to this structure, trying to parse the full `multipart/form-data` as JSON will not succeed until you specifically grab the `payload_json` entity. Competent web frameworks should handle the multipart parsing, so you can easily access the relevant form values.

See [here](https://gitea.ivr.fi/Leppunen/runelite-dink-api/src/branch/master/handlers/dinkHandler.js) for an example project that leverages [`@fastify/multipart`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart) to read the JSON payload and screenshot file.  
For Cloudflare Workers, utilize the [`request.formData()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/formData) method.  
For Express, utilize the [`Multer`](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) middleware.  
For Golang, utilize the [`ParseMultipartForm`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.ParseMultipartForm) function.  
For http4k, utilize the [`http4k-multipart`](https://www.http4k.org/guide/howto/use_multipart_forms/#lens_typesafe_validating_api_-_reads_all_contents_onto_diskmemory) module.  
For Ktor, utilize the [`receiveMultipart`](https://ktor.io/docs/requests.html#form_data) method.  
For Jooby, utilize the [`form`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.jooby/jooby/3.0.9/io.jooby/io/jooby/Context.html#form%28java.lang.String%29) method.  
For Vert.x-Web, utilize the [`formAttributes`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/http/HttpServerRequest.html#formAttributes--) method.  
For Quarkus, utilize the [`@RestForm`](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest#multipart) annotation.  
For Spring, utilize the [`@RequestPart`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestPart.html) annotation.

In the examples below, `content` is populated instead of `embeds` for simplicity; this would correspond to the advanced setting 'Use Rich Embeds' being disabled. Third-party integrations should rely on the `extra` object instead of `content`/`embeds`.

### All

JSON sent with every notification:

```json5
{
  "content": "Text message as set by the user",
  "extra": {},
  "type": "NOTIFICATION_TYPE",
  "playerName": "your rsn",
  "accountType": "NORMAL | IRONMAN | HARDCORE_IRONMAN",
  "seasonalWorld": "true | false",
  "dinkAccountHash": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
  "embeds": []
}
```

JSON sent with every notification but only in certain circumstances:

```json5
{
  "clanName": "Dink QA",
  "groupIronClanName":"Dink QA",
  "discordUser":{
    "id":"012345678910111213",
    "name":"Gamer",
    "avatarHash":"abc123def345abc123def345abc123de"
  },
  "world": 518,
  "regionId": 12850,
```

`clanName` is only sent when the player is in a clan and has the advanced setting `Send Clan Name` enabled.  
`groupIronClanName` is only sent when the player is a GIM and has the advanced setting `Send GIM Clan Name` enabled.  
The `discordUser` object is only sent when Discord is open and the advanced setting `Send Discord Profile` is enabled.  
`world` and `regionId` are only sent when the advanced setting `Include Location` is enabled (default: true).

Note: The examples below omit `playerName`, `accountType`, and `dinkAccountHash` keys because they are always the same.

### Deaths

JSON for non-combat death:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has died...",
  "extra": {
    "valueLost": 300,
    "isPvp": false,

      "plane": 0,
      "instanced": false
    }
  },
  "type": "DEATH"
}
```

JSON for PvP scenarios:

  "content": "%USERNAME% has just been PKed by %PKER% for %VALUELOST% gp...",
  "extra": {
    "valueLost": 300,
    "isPvp": true,
    "killerName": "%PKER%",
    "keptItems": [],

      "regionId": 10546,
      "plane": 0,
      "instanced": false
    }
  },

        "quantity": 100,
        "priceEach": 3,
        "name": "Feather"

    "location": {
      "regionId": 10546,
      "plane": 0,
      "instanced": false
    }
  },
  "type": "DEATH"
}
```

### Collection

JSON for Collection Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has added %ITEM% to their collection",
  "extra": {
    "itemName": "Zamorak chaps",
    "itemId": 10372,
    "price": 500812,

    "dropperName": "Clue Scroll (Hard)",
    "dropperType": "EVENT",
    "dropperKillCount": 1500
  },
  "type": "COLLECTION"
}
```

Note: `dropperName`/`dropperType`/`dropperKillCount` may not be present for all collection log notifications.

### Level

JSON for Levelups:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has levelled %SKILL%",
  "extra": {
    "levelledSkills": {
      // These are the skills that dinked
      "Skill name": 30
    },
    "allSkills": {
      // These are all the skills
      "Skill name": 30,

      "value": 50,
      "increased": false
    }
  },
  "type": "LEVEL"
}
```

Note: Level 127 in JSON corresponds to attaining max experience in a skill (200M).

JSON for XP Milestones:

```json5

    "interval": 5000000 // The configured XP interval
  },
  "type": "XP_MILESTONE"
}
```

### Loot

JSON for Loot Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has looted: \n\n%LOOT%\nFrom: %SOURCE%",
  "extra": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 1234,
        "quantity": 1,
        "priceEach": 42069,
        "name": "Some item",
        "rarity": null
      }
    ],
    "source": "Giant rat",
    "category": "NPC",
    "killCount": 60,
    "rarestProbability": 0.001
  },
  "type": "LOOT"
}
```

`killCount` is only specified for NPC loot with the base RuneLite Loot Tracker plugin enabled.

`rarity` is currently only populated for NPC drops. This data is (imperfectly) scraped from the wiki, so it may not be 100% accurate. Also, we do not report a rarity if the NPC always drops the item on every kill.

The items are valued at GE prices (when possible) if the user has not disabled the `Use actively traded price` base RuneLite setting. Otherwise, the store price of the item is used.

### Slayer

JSON for Slayer Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has completed a slayer task: %TASK%, getting %POINTS% points and making that %TASKCOUNT% tasks completed",
  "extra": {
    "slayerTask": "Slayer task name",
    "slayerCompleted": "30",
    "slayerPoints": "15",
    "killCount": 135,

    "totalQuests": 156,
    "questPoints": 44,
    "totalQuestPoints": 293
  },
  "type": "QUEST"
}
```

### Clue

JSON for Clue Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has completed a %CLUE% clue, they have completed %COUNT%.\nThey obtained:\n\n%LOOT%",
  "extra": {
    "clueType": "Beginner",
    "numberCompleted": 123,
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 1234,
        "quantity": 1,
        "priceEach": 42069,
        "name": "Some item"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "CLUE"
}
```

The items are valued at GE prices (when possible) if the user has not disabled the `Use actively traded price` base RuneLite setting. Otherwise, the store price of the item is used.

### Kill Count

JSON for Kill Count Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has defeated %BOSS% with a completion count of %COUNT%",
  "extra": {
    "boss": "King Black Dragon",
    "count": 69,
    "gameMessage": "Your King Black Dragon kill count is: 69."
  },
  "type": "KILL_COUNT"
}
```

Note: when `boss` is `Penance Queen`, `count` refers to the high level gamble count, rather than kill count.

### Combat Achievements

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has completed %TIER% combat task: %TASK%",
  "extra": {
    "tier": "GRANDMASTER",

{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has unlocked the rewards for the %COMPLETED% tier, by completing the combat task: %TASK%",
  "extra": {

    "petName": "Ikkle hydra",
    "milestone": "5,000 killcount",
    "duplicate": false
  },
  "type": "PET"

```

`petName` is only included if the game sent it to the users chat via untradeable drop, collection log, or clan notifications.  
`milestone` is only included if a clan notification was triggered.

### Speedrunning

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has just beat their personal best in a speedrun of %QUEST% with a time of %TIME%",
  "extra": {

    "victimCombatLevel": 69,
    "victimEquipment": {
      "AMULET": {
        "id": 1731,
        "priceEach": 1987,
        "name": "Amulet of power"
      },
      "WEAPON": {
        "id": 1333,
        "priceEach": 14971,
        "name": "Rune scimitar"
      },
      "TORSO": {
        "id": 1135,
        "priceEach": 4343,
        "name": "Green d'hide body"
      },
      "LEGS": {

      "plane": 0
    },
    "myHitpoints": 20,
    "myLastDamage": 12
  }
}
```

`world` and `location` are _not_ sent if the user has disabled the "Include Location" notifier setting.

### Group Storage

JSON for GIM Bank Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% has deposited: %DEPOSITED% | %USERNAME% has withdrawn: %WITHDRAWN%",
  "type": "GROUP_STORAGE",
  "accountType": "GROUP_IRONMAN | HARDCORE_GROUP_IRONMAN",
  "extra": {
    "groupName": "group name",
    "deposits": [
      {
        "id": 315,
        "name": "Shrimps",
        "quantity": 2,
        "priceEach": 56
      },
      {
        "id": 1205,
        "name": "Bronze dagger",
        "quantity": 1,
        "priceEach": 53
      }
    ],
    "withdrawals": [
      {
        "id": 1265,
        "name": "Bronze pickaxe",
        "quantity": 1,
        "priceEach": 22
      }
    ],
    "netValue": 143
  }
}
```

`accountType` is always `GROUP_IRONMAN` or `HARDCORE_GROUP_IRONMAN` for Group Storage notifications.

### Grand Exchange

JSON for GE Notifications:

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% %TYPE% %ITEM% on the GE",
  "type": "GRAND_EXCHANGE",
  "extra": {
    "slot": 1,
    "status": "SOLD",
    "item": {
      "id": 314,
      "quantity": 2,
      "priceEach": 3,

    },
    "marketPrice": 2,
    "targetPrice": 3,
    "targetQuantity": 2,
    "sellerTax": 0
  }
}
```

Unlike `GrandExchangeOfferChanged#getSlot`, `extra.slot` is one-indexed;
values can range from 1 to 8 (inclusive) for members, and 1 to 3 (inclusive) for F2P.

See [javadocs](https://static.runelite.net/api/runelite-api/net/runelite/api/GrandExchangeOfferState.html) for the possible values of `extra.status`.

### Player Trades

```json5
{
  "content": "%USERNAME% traded with %COUNTERPARTY%",
  "type": "TRADE",
  "extra": {
    "counterparty": "%COUNTERPARTY%",

      {
        "id": 314,
        "quantity": 100,

    ],
    "givenItems": [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "quantity": 3,
        "priceEach": 150,

      }
    ],
    "receivedValue": 200,
    "givenValue": 450

```

### Leagues

JSON for Area Unlock Notifications:

```json5
{
  "type": "LEAGUES_AREA",

  "accountType": "IRONMAN",
  "seasonalWorld": true,
  "extra": {
    "area": "Kandarin",
    "index": 2,
    "tasksCompleted": 200,
    "tasksUntilNextArea": 200
  }
}
```

Note: `index` refers to the order of region unlocks.  
Here, Kandarin was the second region selected.  
For all players, Karamja is the _zeroth_ region selected (and there is no notification for Misthalin).

JSON for Relic Chosen Notifications:

```json5
{
  "type": "LEAGUES_RELIC",
  "content": "%USERNAME% unlocked a Tier 1 Relic: Production Prodigy.",
  "accountType": "IRONMAN",
  "seasonalWorld": true,
  "extra": {
    "relic": "Production Prodigy",
    "tier": 1,
    "requiredPoints": 0,
    "totalPoints": 20,
    "pointsUntilNextTier": 480
  }
}
```

JSON for Task Completed Notifications:

```json5
{
  "type": "LEAGUES_TASK",
  "content": "%USERNAME% completed a Easy task: Pickpocket a Citizen.",
  "accountType": "IRONMAN",
  "seasonalWorld": true,
  "extra": {
    "taskName": "Pickpocket a Citizen",
    "difficulty": "EASY",
    "taskPoints": 10,
    "totalPoints": 30,
    "tasksCompleted": 3,
    "tasksUntilNextArea": 57,
    "pointsUntilNextRelic": 470,
    "pointsUntilNextTrophy": 2470
  }
}
```

JSON for Task Notifications that unlocked a Trophy:

```json5
{
  "type": "LEAGUES_TASK",
  "content": "%USERNAME% completed a Hard task, The Frozen Door, unlocking the Bronze trophy!",
  "accountType": "IRONMAN",
  "seasonalWorld": true,
  "extra": {
    "taskName": "The Frozen Door",
    "difficulty": "HARD",
    "taskPoints": 80,
    "totalPoints": 2520,
    "tasksCompleted": 119,
    "tasksUntilNextArea": 81,
    "pointsUntilNextRelic": 1480,
    "pointsUntilNextTrophy": 2480,
    "earnedTrophy": "Bronze"
  }
}
```

Note: Fields like `tasksUntilNextArea`, `pointsUntilNextRelic`, and `pointsUntilNextTrophy` can be omitted if there is no next level of progression
(i.e., all three regions selected, all relic tiers unlocked, all trophies acquired).

`accountType` is always `IRONMAN` for Leagues, unrelated to what the user is outside of Leagues.

### Chat

JSON for Matching Chat Message Notifications:

```json5
{
  "type": "CHAT",
  "content": "%USERNAME% received a chat message: `You've been playing for a while, consider taking a break from your screen.`",
  "extra": {
    "type": "GAMEMESSAGE",
    "message": "You've been playing for a while, consider taking a break from your screen.",
    "source": null
  }
}
```

Note: The possible values for `extra.type` are documented in RuneLite's [javadocs](https://static.runelite.net/api/runelite-api/net/runelite/api/ChatMessageType.html).

When `extra.type` corresponds to a player-sent message (e.g., `PUBLICCHAT`, `PRIVATECHAT`, `FRIENDSCHAT`, `CLAN_CHAT`, `CLAN_GUEST_CHAT`),
the `extra.source` value is set to the player's name that sent the message.

When `extra.type` is `UNKNOWN`, the `extra.source` value is set to the originating runelite event (e.g., `CommandExecuted`, `NotificationFired`).

### Metadata

  "content": "%USERNAME% logged into World %WORLD%",
